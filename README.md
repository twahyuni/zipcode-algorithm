# Zip Code Algorithm

### Exercise
Generate an array containing all the consecutive zip codes in a range from min to max. All zip codes have the same structure: /[A-Z][0-9][A-Z][0-9][A-Z][0-9]/

The range is:
range_start = 'A0A1A0'
range_end = 'B3P1D3'

The end result should look like:
```javascript
[
  'A0A1A0',
  'A0A1A1',
  'A0A1A2',
  'A0A1A3',
  'A0A1A4',
  'A0A1A5',
  'A0A1A6',
  'A0A1A7',
  'A0A1A8',
  'A0A1A9',
  'A0A1B0',
  ...
  'B3P1D3'
]
```
